A simple experimental programming language implementing `finite difference`_ using stencils_.

.. _finite difference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference
.. _stencils: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_(numerical_analysis)

It is written in RPython_ and uses RPLY_ for lexing and parsing.

Compatibility
=============

PyPy â‰¥ 2.0-beta2

Inspiration
===========

The following tutorial blog posts by Andrew Brown helped immensely in starting this project:

* `Tutorial: Writing an Interpreter with PyPy, Part 1 <http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interpreter-with-pypy.html>`_
* `Tutorial Part 2: Adding a JIT <http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-part-2-adding-jit.html>`_

In addition, Alex Gaynor's Topaz_ project, a Ruby implementation written in RPython, has been especially helpful as a reference for using RPython and RPLY.
